# frontend-coursera-assignment5
Front end course by Prof. Yaakov from John Hopkins University
<b> Here is what I did in order to complete the assignment:
</b>
<ol>
  <li>Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, module5-solution or mod5_solution, etc.</li>  
  <li>Once you update your repository, copy all the contents of the fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment5/assignment5-solution-starter folder into your newly created solutions container folder for this assignment, e.g., module5-solution.</li>
  <li>There are 4-5 fairly simple steps to implement the required functionality
    <ul>
      <li>Open up js/script.js file.</li>
      <li>Find TODO: STEP 0, and follow the instructions until you are done with TODO: STEP 4. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once you are done, verify that the desired functionality is working correctly. Use Browser Sync or deploy your solution to GitHub pages.</li>
</ol>
